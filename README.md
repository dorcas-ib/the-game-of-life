# game-of-life

this repository contains a function for defining state of a game of life cell intended to practice unit testing. It may not deliver all of the expected functionality!


The function verifyCell will take values for currentState: 1 = live, 0 = dead
                              and Neighbours: integer from 1-9 to indicate number of neighbours.

It returns a value for the new state: 1 = live, 0 = dead

The value returned will be generated using the rules for conway's game of life.
